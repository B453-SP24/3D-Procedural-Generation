Instructions:
1. Fork this repo and use this project as your base
2. Complete the given objectives for your prototype

# 3D-Procedural-Generation

- You must either procedurally generate (at runtime) the environment, terrain, or objects within the world.
- You must also procedurally generate a random quest objective that the player must complete within the world every time the game is run.
- There must be some sort of enemy that interacts with the player in a negative way (does not have to be combat)


Your code can be as messy, terrible, and unoptimized as you want! This is only a prototype

# What is Rapid Prototyping?
Rapid prototyping in video game development refers to the process of quickly creating playable versions of game concepts or features to test their feasibility, gameplay mechanics, and overall fun factor. It's a crucial phase in game development that allows designers and developers to iterate on ideas rapidly, gather feedback, and refine the game before investing significant time and resources into full production.
